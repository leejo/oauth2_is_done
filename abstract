A couple of years ago I started down the rabbit hole that is OAuth2 and manged
to implement a plugin for Mojolicious. Since then I have managed to abstract
out a lot of the internals and now have a module to support all four OAuth2
flows, which is de-coupled from any specific web framework.

This talk will cover those four OAuth2 flows, with examples of using the module
and plugins to implement an OAuth2 authorization server in your framework of
choice.

Strong coffee is advised as a prerequisite to attending this talk.
